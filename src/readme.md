Added autoPlayer

- When autoPlayer selects an eight, it will select 
a suit based on the highest freq of suits in the hand.
- Will look through the hand for matching suits and ranks that are not eights. If none are found, look for an eight to 
  play. 

Added reshuffle, at the start of the game, only draws an eight as the first card.

Added discarded cards back into the deck having only one deck list.
